Review:
Potential Issues, Bugs, or Flaws:
- The `participantList` configuration has an "enabled" attribute within it, but it's not allowed by the schema definition. It's likely that this change will result in a schema validation error when the manifest is processed.
- The `chatView` property is added to the configuration, but there is no mention of it in the "fields" array. It seems like this property should also be included in the "fields" array to define its behavior.

Code Suggestions and Improvements:
- Consider removing the "enabled" property within the `participantList` configuration as it doesn't align with the schema's expected structure, or modify it accordingly to match the schema definition.
- Add the "chatView" property to the "fields" array to properly define its behavior and ensure it's accounted for when processing the configuration.
