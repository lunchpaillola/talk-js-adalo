Review:
Potential issues, bugs, or flaws:

1. In the `ConversationUI` component, the `useEffect` hook has an incorrect conditional check. The condition `if (!chatView)` should be reviewed as it might not be the intended logic. It seems to override the behavior for `chatView === false` which might not be the desired behavior.
   
Code Suggestions, Improvements, etc:

1. It's good to see the addition of the `chatView` prop in the `TalkJs` component, allowing for more flexibility and customization.

2. The addition of the `styles` constant in the `ConversationUI` component for defining the wrapper style is a good practice to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Well-handled loading component implementations throughout the codebase, and the use of styles constant to avoid duplication in the loading component styles. Good use of standardization and consistency.
